I am a highly-motivated and hard-working analyst with high-level data analysis & business intelligence skills and a background in finance.
I am very adept at writing complex SQL queries and Power BI reporting, including both building dashboards in Power BI Desktop and managing workspaces in Power BI Service.
My educational background includes an MBA in Analytics, a BSBA in International Business, and over 300 hours of self-led study in SQL, Power BI, and Python.

While I have spent nearly a decade in finance conducting various forms of financial analysis and reporting on financial data, I discovered my true passion lies in data analysis and business intelligence.
Data analytics is interesting to me because it encapsulates so much more than just money.

This portfolio is to showcase my technical abilities and how they can be used in a data-enabled role on a finance or data analytics team. It includes various flavors of SQL code and Power BI dashboards/reports for data visualization, and it includes Python code for data manipulation, visualization, and beginner data science.

As someone looking to elevate their career, this portfolio shows my readiness for a more technical role within the field of finance or data analytics.
If companies are looking for an all-around analyst - financial or otherwise - with a strong business acumen that can write SQL, Python, or manipulate and visualize data in Power BI, this portfolio will exhibit my skill in all three.
